Python Quiz App - README Overview This Python Quiz App is a simple GUI-based quiz application built using the Tkinter library. It presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, records their answers, and displays their final score upon completion. The app dynamically updates questions and options during runtime, making it easy to add or modify the quiz data.

Features Multiple-choice questions: Four answer options for each question. Interactive GUI: Radio buttons allow users to select their answer. Real-time feedback: Tracks score and displays results in a message box. Customizable: Add, remove, or update questions by modifying the quiz_data list.

Requirements Python 3.x Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

How to Use Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., quiz_app.py). Run the file using your Python interpreter.
The app will display one question at a time with four options. Select your answer by clicking on the button corresponding to the option. Click Next to proceed to the next question. 
After the final question, the app will display your total score.
